# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Web text now uses the same glyph atlas as native: stb_truetype compiled into the wasm
  (`src/text/stb_wasm_impl.c` + a malloc/libm shim) shapes and rasterizes glyphs, the web Host
  measures with `teak-text` (layout == render, and chrome's web render is pixel-identical to
  native), and glyphs no shipped face has (CJK, symbols) are rasterized by canvas 2D one cluster
  at a time. The `.fonts` files are embedded in the wasm (and still copied to `dist/fonts/` for
  the canvas fallback); a small Plex Mono subset is embedded as the default face. Text is
  vertically centred in buttons on web now. `glyph_cache.zig`, `textured_quad.wgsl` and the old
  `rasterizeText` web path are removed. Chrome's wasm grows ~19 KB gzip (stripped).
- `shaders/glyph.wgsl` reads the instance as raw 32-bit words (shared by native and web, since
  zunk vertex formats are 32-bit). `TextStage` (src/gpu/text_stage.zig) holds the backend-neutral
  staging code with a shaped-run cache; `teak-text`'s `measure` has a small result cache.

- Native text (Linux, Windows) is drawn from a glyph atlas: shaped glyphs are packed into R8
  pages and drawn as instanced quads (`shaders/glyph.wgsl`), replacing the per-string BGRA
  texture cache. Text is rasterized at the device pixel size with quarter-pixel x positioning.
  `.mono` text now snaps advances to whole pixels by default (`FontSpec.snap_advance = null`
  resolves to on for `.mono`; set `false` for the old fractional advances); screenshots shift
  by a pixel here and there. `InitOptions` gains `scale` and `max_atlas_pages`.
- The Gpu contract's `rasterizeText` is optional (web only); the native `Rasterizer` provider
  contract is now per glyph (see `docs/features/gpu.md`). The Windows backend uses stb_truetype
  (`TEAK_FONT`, then `C:\Windows\Fonts\consola.ttf`) and measures through `teak-text` too;
  `Host.registerFont` now works on Windows.

### Added

- `Shaper` / `ShapedGlyph` / `ShapeResult` (core) and `FontSpec.snap_advance` (default false).
- `teak-text` now ships `SimpleShaper` (stb kerning, fi/fl/ff/ffi/ffl ligatures on proportional
  faces) in `src/text/`; the module root moved from `src/gpu/text_stbtt.zig` to `src/text/text.zig`
  (same exports). Measurement and rasterization both place glyphs from the shaper; invalid
  UTF-8 now yields U+FFFD per bad byte (was byte-as-codepoint).

### Changed

- **wgpu-native prebuilts updated v25.0.2.2 -> v29.0.1.1** (all four Windows/Linux deps). No source API fixes were needed (the v25 code already used the StringView / callback-info API); device creation now installs an uncaptured-error callback that logs loudly, and sets the device-lost callback mode explicitly.

### Changed (breaking)

- **Zig 0.17.0 is now required; 0.16 support is dropped.** See
  [docs/migration-0.17.md](docs/migration-0.17.md).
  - Array/string `**` repeats replaced with `@splat` (library, examples, tests).
  - Comptime component composition (`Components`, `ComponentList`) and the
    build-time web-font table use the parallel-array `@typeInfo` layout.
  - `@cImport` replaced by `b.addTranslateC` modules `wgpu-c` and `stb-c`,
    wired up in `linkNativeWgpu`, `linkWebWgpu`, `linkHeadless` and the
    library's own test steps.
  - `b.args` replaced by `Run.addPassthruArgs()` in every example build and in
    the docs.
  - `builtin.mode` comparisons use the lowercase `.debug` spelling.
  - `rich_zig` (counter_greeter) and zunk's `webzocket` / `rich_zig` pins moved
    to their 0.17 branches.
  - CI and docs updated to Zig 0.17.0.
