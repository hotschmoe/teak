# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Native text (Linux, Windows) is drawn from a glyph atlas: shaped glyphs are packed into R8
  pages and drawn as instanced quads (`shaders/glyph.wgsl`), replacing the per-string BGRA
  texture cache. Text is rasterized at the device pixel size with quarter-pixel x positioning.
  `.mono` text now snaps advances to whole pixels by default (`FontSpec.snap_advance = null`
  resolves to on for `.mono`; set `false` for the old fractional advances); screenshots shift
  by a pixel here and there. `InitOptions` gains `scale` and `max_atlas_pages`.
- The Gpu contract's `rasterizeText` is optional (web only); the native `Rasterizer` provider
  contract is now per glyph (see `docs/features/gpu.md`). The Windows backend uses stb_truetype
  (`TEAK_FONT`, then `C:\Windows\Fonts\consola.ttf`) and measures through `teak-text` too;
  `Host.registerFont` now works on Windows.

### Added

- **X11 host parity** (issues #4, part of #7). `src/platform/x11.zig`:
  - Clipboard: `Clipboard.write` / `write_clipboard` own the `CLIPBOARD`
    selection and answer `SelectionRequest` (`TARGETS`, `UTF8_STRING`,
    `STRING`, `TEXT`, `text/plain`); `Clipboard.read` does a bounded
    synchronous `XConvertSelection` round trip; an unclaimed Ctrl+V becomes
    `.pasted_text` (or a `.dropped` PNG image) asynchronously, with INCR on
    receive.
  - XDND v5 drops: `text/uri-list` files and `UTF8_STRING` text arrive as
    `.dropped` like the web host.
  - Input methods: XIM input context with on-the-spot preedit callbacks
    feeding `imeState()`, `Xutf8LookupString` text (also Compose / dead keys),
    `Host.setImeSpot` for the over-the-spot style, clean fallback when no IM.
  - `zig build test-x11` (live display, skips without `DISPLAY`) drives the
    host with xclip / xdotool and an in-process XDND source.

### Fixed

- X11 host failed to compile on first use under Zig 0.17 (`Xlib.load` still
  used the removed `@typeInfo(...).fields`).

- `teak.Combobox(cap)`: searchable select (query field + filtered overlay list with scrolling, type-ahead
  highlight, keyboard, "No matches" row), composed from existing primitives; chrome's MATERIAL field uses it (#2).
- Cookbook recipe 6b + tested `LoadRow`/`LoadApp` example: rows owning several focusable fields (#1).
- `teak.unicode`, `teak.linebreak`, `teak.text_wrap`: UAX#29 graphemes, word classes, UAX#14-lite line
  breaking, wrapping/measure/caret mapping (text-engine PR2a/b).
- `teak.editor`: `Editor(cap, undo_cap)` with grapheme-aware editing, word jumps, undo/redo (PR10).
- `SpecialKey`: `ctrl_left/right/home/end` (+ `ctrl_shift_*`), `ctrl_backspace`, `ctrl_delete`,
  `ctrl_shift_z`; `resolveKey` maps them.
- `Shaper` / `ShapedGlyph` / `ShapeResult` (core) and `FontSpec.snap_advance` (default false).
- `teak-text` now ships `SimpleShaper` (stb kerning, fi/fl/ff/ffi/ffl ligatures on proportional
  faces) in `src/text/`; the module root moved from `src/gpu/text_stbtt.zig` to `src/text/text.zig`
  (same exports). Measurement and rasterization both place glyphs from the shaper; invalid
  UTF-8 now yields U+FFFD per bad byte (was byte-as-codepoint).

### Changed

- `Dropdown`/`Combobox`: the keyboard-highlighted row now also takes the theme's `hover_fg` (fixes invisible labels on inverting themes).
- `TextField(N)` is now built on `Editor`: backspace/Delete remove whole grapheme clusters, multi-byte
  characters typed byte-wise are inserted atomically, and it gains `delete`, `home`/`end`, word jumps,
  `undo`/`redo` Msgs (the `Model` field names `len`/`cursor`/`selection_anchor` are unchanged; the byte array is now `buf`).

- **wgpu-native prebuilts updated v25.0.2.2 -> v29.0.1.1** (all four Windows/Linux deps). No source API fixes were needed (the v25 code already used the StringView / callback-info API); device creation now installs an uncaptured-error callback that logs loudly, and sets the device-lost callback mode explicitly.

### Changed (breaking)

- **Zig 0.17.0 is now required; 0.16 support is dropped.** See
  [docs/migration-0.17.md](docs/migration-0.17.md).
  - Array/string `**` repeats replaced with `@splat` (library, examples, tests).
  - Comptime component composition (`Components`, `ComponentList`) and the
    build-time web-font table use the parallel-array `@typeInfo` layout.
  - `@cImport` replaced by `b.addTranslateC` modules `wgpu-c` and `stb-c`,
    wired up in `linkNativeWgpu`, `linkWebWgpu`, `linkHeadless` and the
    library's own test steps.
  - `b.args` replaced by `Run.addPassthruArgs()` in every example build and in
    the docs.
  - `builtin.mode` comparisons use the lowercase `.debug` spelling.
  - `rich_zig` (counter_greeter) and zunk's `webzocket` / `rich_zig` pins moved
    to their 0.17 branches.
  - CI and docs updated to Zig 0.17.0.
